## Description of and approach to building application.

The stash application is an online inventory of a user's yarn "stash".
Knitters acquire yarn frequently when they want to start a new knitting project.
Most knitters keep large containers of yarn in the back of a closet.
An online inventory will help knitters to keep the yarn they have visible.

The application was developed by adding a user feature at a time with constant testing.
Curl scripts were created for testing POST, GET, PATCH and DELETE api actions.

Technologies used are html, css, javascript, bootstrap and AJAX.
